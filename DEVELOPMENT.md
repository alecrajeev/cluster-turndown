## Generating turndown schedule CRD code

To re-generate the code for the defined CRDs, do the following:
```sh
bash generate.sh
```

The script is based on https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller, specifically https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/hack/update-codegen.sh.
